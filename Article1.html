  		<h2>History of photography</h2>

  		<p>
        “Photography is the science, art and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.”
This is the explanation of Wikipedia, photography is far more than that. It is the art of documenting a moment in life to save for the future. Many people make photographs for their family, to remember something when they are old, and the list goes on and on. But today I am going to talk about the history of photography, how it al started…
      <br>
        Photography is the result of combining several technical discoveries. Long before the first photographs were made, Chinese philosopher Mo Di and Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid described a pinhole camera in the 5th and 4th centuries before christ. But around the year 1800, Thomas Wedgwood made the first known attempt to capture the image in a camera obscura. The camera obscura literally means “dark chamber” in Latin. It is a box with a hole in it with allows light to go through and create an image onto the piece of paper. Thomas Wedgwood used paper or white leather treated with silver nitrate. The shadow images eventually darkened all over.
The first permanent photo was an image produced in 1822 by the French inventor Nicéphore Niépce, but is was destroyed in a later attempt to make prints from it. Three years later was Niépce successful again, he made the View from the Window at Le Gras, the earliest surviving photograph from nature. But to make this picture it required an extremely long exposure, the amount of light per area.
      <br><img src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras,_Joseph_Nicéphore_Niépce.jpg/1024px-View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras,_Joseph_Nicéphore_Niépce.jpg">
        Niépce sought to greatly improve his exposure process. In partnership with Louis Daguerre, he worked out post-exposure precessing methods. The partners kept this a secret.
John Herschel made many contributions to the new field, He invented the cyanotype process, later familiar as the “blueprint”. He was the first to use the term “photography”, “negative” and “positive”. John Herschel was also the first to make glass negatives in 1839.
      <br>
      Many advances in photographic glass plates and printing were made during the rest of the 19th century. In 1891, Gabriel Lippmann introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the interference of light waves. His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1908.
Glass plates were the medium for most original camera photography from the late 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old.
      <br>
      The search to capture a image started around the year 1800, but was really successful much later. As you have read the first actual permanent picture was made in 1822. Progress was made shortly after this and as you can see nowadays pictures and cameras are everywhere.
