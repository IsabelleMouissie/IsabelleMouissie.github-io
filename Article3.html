      Mario Testino (was born on October 30, 1954) is a Peruvian fashion photographer. His work has been featured in magazines such as Vogue and Vanity Fair. One of fashion's most sought-after snappers, Mario Testino was born in 1954 in Lima, Peru. He came to London in 1976, took a flat in an abandoned hospital near Trafalgar Square, and began selling portfolios (for £25, including hair and make-up) to wannabe models. Today he is best known for his highly polished, exotically bright ad campaigns and his exquisitely styled photographs of the couture scene all of which carry a deceptive air of nonchalance. Now at the top of his profession, Testino has shot Madonna for Versace as well as photographing the late Diana, Princess of Wales for her famous Vanity Fair cover in 1997. His popularity with designers and fashion editors stems as much from his professionalism and good nature as his unerring ability to take beautiful pictures which sell clothes.

Timothy Hogan’s driven self-motivation keeps him on his own two feet. As a photographer, director, cinematographer, and avid surfer, he is a jack of all trades, working with global clients on everything but the kitchen sink – from still life, to film, to fashion. He recently produced a collection of photos entitled, “The FIN Project” that merges his love for still life and an obsession with surfing with the goal of exposing “the shape of the wave… and the way a quarter of an inch can make a dog into a ‘magic’ board.” Few photographers have chronicled surfboard fins, and Hogan has breached the topic, with a mix of modern and old architecture – some wood, some color, each one with its own distinct aura. The photos remind us of how the simplicity of objects can become in their own way, beautiful masterpieces.

She chose babies as her subject because of her love of them. "I had seen the way children and babies were generally being photographed. It just didn't seem realistic to me that people took their children along to photographic studios all dressed in their Sunday best, photographs that didn't really show the personality of the child."Geddes believes that "emotional content is an image's most important element" and that people are drawn to her work because of its simplicity and personality. prefers the black-and-white scheme because she feels that colour distracts from the image and the natural beauty of life.

She has made award-winning photographs for advertising campaigns and corporate communication, has shot a large body of work available as ‘stock’ photography via gettyimages, and explores experimental technical and conceptual possibilities of photography in her fine arts series.Her images, like that of PotsdamerPlatz in Berlin, look fragmented and deformed as though taken from a superordinate perspective that can document multiple angles at one time while maintaining the same vantage point. The way in which the images stage the subject, piece together the subject like a boxy mosaic, and make reality look both new and voluminous, recalls Cubist experiments.
